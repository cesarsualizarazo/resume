  <p>I am a professional with a BSc in Business Information Systems. I’ve got more than 10 years of
    experience in sales and technology areas in multinational companies, focused on products and services
     PaaS (Platform as a Service) or SaaS (Software as a Service) Sales in a B2B model in the Payment
     Industry mostly providing services like payment gateways, POS, eWallets, Alternative Payments Methods,
     Issuing, Acquiring business, Multicurrency accounts and remittances. In my experience I have managed to
     work in complex sales with long cycles, different decision makers, complex negotiations, execute
     strategies and plans impacting positively: in the product expansion providing potential partnerships
     in LatAm, creating and maintaining business relationships with partners and key accounts, in annual
     sales quota and maximizing the pipeline by developing new business opportunities to growth market share
     in banking and fintechs. </P>
